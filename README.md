# My-Portfolio


What made me want to build this portfolio was to be able to have a website that can house all of my skills, resume, and contact information in one area for future employers.

I built this project for potention employers to be able to look at the projects that I have done and be able to showcase my skills in the areas that I have studied.

In this project i have learned how to create a website from scratch and add styling to it using CSS.


Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
When navigating through the webpage, there are sections that you can go to in order to see the projects I have completed. There is a section explaining information about myself and there is also a section in case anyone would like to contact me.
